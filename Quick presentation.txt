I put here some codes of my project in different fields of computer scien. It is just a simple
presentation and does not represent all the work I did in y school, just a little introduction of what
I do and I can do.

I've put the main code just so you can grasp the idea, because if a limited amount of space I have on git.
I've deleted some unnecessary files lie images or build files. So it may not work on running.

Here are the projects I've put here (all in french), just have a quick glance on what you're interested on:

Project AI:
The most recent one, it's just my code to create IA solving problems lie the wolf/goat/cabbage problem or missionary problem.
I started those courses recently, and did a bit of coding to try it out.

Projet MatlabComputerVision:
A machine learning classifier, a matlab code that use a dataset of image to classify through a model of logistic regression two classes.
There is a part to create the classifier, and another which is an application to a problem of dataset images of melanoma(skin cancer).

Project QTGUI:
A QT project to develop an interface so a user can imput parameters and initials conditions of a limit element problem. It return a automatticaly
generated configuration file that can be used for running a simulation program (not present here). 

Projectmajeur:
My major project, create a webpage, androidapp, arduino script, connected to a springserver (also developed) that refresh a database in real time,
and allow to modify the status of a philips lamp remotely using MQTT and Http protocols.

Project DiskRecovery:
The subject of one of my exam. I had 3 hours to develop some shellscripts to recover databytes in a virtually broken disk. I've removed the disk data
in BLOCKS File for saving some space. Not much to say expect I was quite found of this one, not because it was part of the reason I got first rank during
my major :). Not the finnest code I ever did, but hey, I only got 3 hours for this.
